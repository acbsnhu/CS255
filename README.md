Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
   The client was the owner of DrivePass a company that wants to help young drivers acquire their drivers’ license
   without the worries of being unprepared or failing their first time taking the test. The main point of the
   system he wants to implement is a system that allows for student drivers to register for drivers training
   and take practice exams that are updated with the newest DMV guidelines. The system would have reading material 
   for the students to study and even offer registration for driving classes with instructors for road experience.
    
What did you do particularly well?
    I think overall I did a good job with the design requirements the client wanted and attempted to implement as
    much as I could in all my designs. Meeting the client’s expectations is a very crucial step and I thought I took
    everything given to me from the client’s perspective and implemented it to the best of my ability.
    
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    If I could revise something from these documents to revise, I think I would start with my sequence diagram. I
    think I could add more to it, to more properly show the sequence of all parts working together. After taking a
    look at it again I feel like there is something missing from the sequence.
    
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider 
the user’s needs when designing?
    I took everything given to me from the client and broke it down into parts based on the user it impacted
    and made sure all these parts were documented and worked into the design of the system. It’s important to
    consider the clients and the users’ needs because they need a system that works for them and fills their needs.
    Designing something neither would want would be counter productive to what is being asked.
    
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and 
design a system?
    My first step to designing is to get the clients frame of thought to be on the same page as them. Whether it
    be page layout, color scheme, or overall functions. I would also want to understand what users it really is going
    to be designed for. For me there is no point in designing something that will not meet its intended purpose. One
    strategy I would like to use in the future would be to get as feedback from the client as possible. To see if they
    like the direction of the features or overall design. Make sure they have as much input as they want that way
    they feel as invested into it as we do and they are happy at launch. Rather than having an initial meeting spending
    time and resources developing something. Then when completed show the client and they are not happy with the
    direction of the system. I would also take advantage of using uml charts in all phases so that the whole team 
    is aware of the steps needed.
